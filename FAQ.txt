Q: Why is there a blank space at 2 AM on the second Sunday of March?
A: Because of the change to daylight saving time (PDT).  The hour between
   2 AM and 3 AM is skipped.

Q: So what about the switch back to standard time (PST) in November?
A: Because an hour is repeated, the "first" one is left out of the table.
   If you happen to be paddling at 1AM/2AM on the first Sunday of November,
   you'll just have to interpolate :)
   Note that the the CSV output from calculate.py will include this time
   period twice.
